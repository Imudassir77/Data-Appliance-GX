# How the refactored structure works

## The `core` module

Contains all absolutely essential building that is necessary to run a connector such as `TransferProcessManager`,
`ProvisionManager`, `DataFlowManager`, various model classes, the protocol engine and the security piece.

This also exposes all extension points via interfaces in the `spi` submodule.

While it is possible to build a connector with just the code from the `edc` module, it will have very limited
capabilities to communicate and to interact with a data space.

## The `implementations` module

Provides basic low-complexity implementations of many of the extension points in order to get a connector up-and-running
quickly. Implementations in this module will be okay for developing/testing but shouldn't be used in enterprise-grade
production environments.

Examples include:

- a file-based configuration module
- a file-based secret vault
- a memory-based transfer process store

All the IDS modules are also located here because they are not strictly speaking required to operate a connector.
However, most actual implementations will likely include them.

## The `common` module

Contains utility code such as collection utils, string utils and helper classes to access Azure Blob Store.

## The `extensions` module

This contains code that extends the connector's core functionality with technology- or cloud-provider-specific code. For
example a transfer process store based on Azure CosmosDB, a secure vault based on Azure KeyVault, etc. Basically, this
contains more production-ready alternatives to the `implementations:minimal` module. This is where technology- and
cloud-specific implementations should go. If you wish to contribute, say, a DB2-database extension - here's where it
should go.

For example, if someone where to create a configuration service based on a Postgres database, then the implementation
should go into a submodule of the `extensions` module.

## The `samples` module

This is similar to the `extensions` module, but focuses more on showing specific use cases rather than technology
extensions. For example, it shows how to run a connector from a unit test in order to try out functionality quickly or
how to implement an outward-facing REST API for a connector.
